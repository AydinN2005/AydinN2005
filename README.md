  About me 🙎‍♂️
</h3>

I am **Aydin Norouzi** a computer engineering student From **Iran 🇮🇷** .

I started my programming world when I was 15 years old with C#. Like everyone else, I didn't know anything at first, but later, with a lot of experience and learning, I got deeper into this story and found my passion in the web field. Now, I try to strengthen my skills every day and learn new things so that I don't fall behind.
